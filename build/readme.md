# Build/Deployment Folder

This folder should always be auto generated by running `pnpm -r run build` at the root of this project. The only files not automatically generated are this readme and the `package.json`. Do not edit the `package.json` unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing.

If you are not setting up the app to be deployed to prod then you do not need to be here. Go back to `server/` and `web/`.
